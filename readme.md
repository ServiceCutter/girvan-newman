This is the implementation of the Girvan-Newman clustering algorithm used by the Service Cutter. Most of the source code is part of the [Gephi Framework](https://gephi.org/) or its [Girvan-Newman plugin](https://github.com/jaroslav-kuchar/GirmanNewmanClustering).

We decided to repackage it in order to remove unnecessary dependencies and maintain the functionality of version 0.8.2 of Gephi as later versions seem to lack the clustering functionality.

See [issue #1](https://github.com/ServiceCutter/ServiceCutter/issues/1) for details.
